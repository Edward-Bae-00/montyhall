This code simulates the famous statistics\brain teaser called the Monty Hall problem.

It simulates when you actually change doors and when you actually stick with the door you chose.

To get the results you just have to run the java code and it will show how many times you won and how many times you lost when the monty hall problem is done 100,000 times. 100,000 simulations are done so the numbers would average to around 66% and 33% depending on if you change doors or not.

The reason that I chose to write this code was so that I could better visualize the problem as the problem appears to go against my intuition. Running the simulations, I am better able to visualize the data.
