<h1>Monty Hall Simulator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Reading over the Monty Hall Problem in my stats class I got very confused and the statistical breakdowns seemed intuitively incorrect. For that reason, I developed this simulation of Monty all problem that simulates the two scenarios when you change the door after the host gives you a door and when you actually stick with the door you choose. I did it so that I could better visualize the problem and confirm that the statistics behind the Monty Hall Problem is correct.


<h2>Requirement To Use</h2>
Any software that runs java code

<h2>How to run the application: </h2>
Download the code and run!

When the code is run, the results will be printed right away of the 100,000 simulations of when you change doors and when you stick with the door you initially chose. Running 100,000 simulations, the numbers average around 66% and 33% depending on whether you change doors or not.
